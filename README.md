Run:

```
$ docker run --detach --net=host --cap-add=NET_ADMIN --cap-add=NET_RAW --volume /var/run/docker.sock:/var/run/docker.sock quay.io/dreae/docker-external-ip
```

After that, if any other Docker container has an environment variable `EXTERNAL_IP` set, with an IP address to use for
containers external IP, iptables will be configured to route container's traffic from that external IP.

A chain named `EXTERNAL_IP` is created in the `nat` table into which all the rules are added.
And one more empty chain is created after this one for any additional custom rules you might want
to add, named `AFTER_EXTERNAL_IP`.
